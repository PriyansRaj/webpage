              Priyans Raj Bhandara. You already played an important role in my

              M. Sison that had once held the highest position in my trust, and
              Priyans Raj Bhandara who suddenly popped up in my life, has
              managed to take over the highest position in my trust in the
              history and present. Thus I, Kristine Joi L. Dagotdot, will have
              the honor to bet my mental health or rather my heart and mind,
